## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm a passionate coder and educator who thrives on sharing knowledge and empowering others through technology. With a solid foundation in Java and Spring, I've built robust applications that solve real-world problems. Lately, I've been diving into the fascinating world of GUIX, Emacs, and Lisp languages, where I find joy in exploring their unique paradigms and capabilities. Whether I'm crafting elegant code or mentoring aspiring developers, my goal is to inspire creativity and foster a love for programming in everyone I meet. Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects! ðŸš€
